The  process  of  target  discovery  or  scanning  is  the  process where worms find new hosts to infect and is a characteristic behaviour that worms exhibit which can be detected and stopped at the network level.  A host-based approach could also be used, however, detecting target discovery at the network level would yield more scans since it detects the traffic directed at multiple hosts.

* localized scanning
* hit-list scanning
